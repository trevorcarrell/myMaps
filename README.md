## Notes

I wish I was able to spend more time on the extensions regarding this app, but I was a little pushed for time. Other than that, I believe everything went smoothly.
There were a few syntax errors, but nothing I couldn't overcome. Hopefully I am able to contribute more to my apps in the future.
